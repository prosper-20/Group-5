This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system tailored for renewable energy installations such as wind turbines and solar panels. The system utilizes a binary search tree (BST) for organizing maintenance tasks by priority and employs a list structure to keep track of scheduled maintenance activities.

Features
Predictive Maintenance Prediction: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict maintenance needs based on historical data and real-time telemetry from energy installations.

Binary Search Tree (BST) for Task Organization: Prioritizes maintenance tasks using a BST, ensuring critical tasks are handled promptly while optimizing scheduling efficiency.

Scheduled Maintenance Tracking: Maintains a list of scheduled maintenance activities, ensuring timely execution and adherence to maintenance schedules.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript (for frontend components)

Frameworks/Libraries:

Python: scikit-learn (for machine learning), Django (for web backend)
JavaScript: React (for frontend UI)
Installation
To run the predictive maintenance system locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/prosper-20/Group-5.git
cd Group-5
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install   # if frontend components are present
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
npm start      # if using React for frontend
Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or another port as specified).

Usage
Logging In: Users can log in to the system using their credentials.

Dashboard: View real-time data and predictions for maintenance needs.

Task Management: Utilize the BST-based task organization
